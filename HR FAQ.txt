 A) strenghts :-
 -------------
  One of my key strengths is my ability to learn from others, regardless of their age or experience. I believe that learning is a continuous process, and valuable 
  insights can come from both seasoned professionals and those who are just starting their careers. From more experienced individuals,I gain deep knowledge and 
  practical wisdom that helps me avoid common pitfalls. At the same time, younger team members often bring fresh perspectives, new technologies, and innovative 
  approaches that challenge my thinking and inspire me to keep evolving. I always strive to be open-minded and learn from anyone around me, 
  which has helped me grow both personally and professionally.



  Weakness:-
  ----------
 I tend to be a perfectionist when working on tasks, always trying to make everything perfect. While this helps me produce good work, it can sometimes make me
 spend more time on a project than needed and cause stress. To handle this, I’ve been learning to balance perfection with getting things done on time by setting 
 realistic goals and focusing on the most important tasks. I also ask for feedback from others to make sure I’m on track, which helps me keep high standards without
 overworking myself. This has improved my time management and reduced stress, while still delivering good results on time."

   building small projects to solidify my understanding. If I get stuck, I don’t hesitate to reach out to colleagues or online communities for guidance. Over time, 
   I've learned that consistent practice and seeking help when needed helps me master new tools quickly.

22)Project with tight deadline?

  into clear, actionable steps. I focus on delivering the most important parts of the project first and make sure to stay on schedule. I try to eliminate distractions

27)Can you describe the flow of your project from start to finish?


  A)The first step in our project is to understand the business requirements. 
    I work closely with stakeholders, such as business analysts, to gather detailed requirements.
    This includes understanding the project’s objectives, user needs.. 
    During this phase, I may also collaborate with the team for analysis.
    Once the requirements are clear,
    hoosing appropriate frameworks, tools, and technologies. For example, if it's a web application, I may use Spring Boot for the backend, 
    I may consider non-functional requirements such as security, error handling, and performance at this stage.
    I write clean, modular, and maintainable code while following coding standards. I regularly commit the code to version control (e.g., Git) and collaborate with the team on code reviews to ensure quality.
   After development, I test the application through unit and integration tests to ensure everything works correctly.
   Once it's tested, I deploy it to a staging environment for user acceptance testing, and after approval,
   I deploy it to production. Post-deployment, I monitor the application and handle any maintenance or bug fixes. Throughout the process,
   I focus on collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement to ensure the project meets its goals and user needs.
