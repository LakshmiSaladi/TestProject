Difference between Group By and Order By:-
------------------------------------------
Group By is used to filter the records and works with aggregation functions like sum(),count(),min(),max(),Avg()..
Order By is used to sort the records and works with ASC or DESC.

After Group By then Order By Will come.

SQL Constraints:-
----------------
Not Null:- Means The column does not allow null values.

UNIQUE:- Means the column does not allow Duplicate values and allows one null value.

Primary Key:- Combination of Not Null and Unique key which uniquely identifies a row.

Foreign Key:- It ensures relationship between tables by referencing primary or unique keys.

CHECK:- It added to a column and that column date should match the CHECK condition.

DEFAULT:- The column have a default value while inserting or when none is provided.

INDEX:-improves query performance.

Auto-increment:-Automatically generates a unique value for columns like primary or unique keys.


Difference between Where and Having:-
-------------------------------------
Where--can be used without Group By and first performs group By and  then aggregation.
Having--Need to use with Group By and first performs aggregation and then group By.
